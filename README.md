# EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-EGI
# Embedded Systems Student Activity

Hello and welcome to the README.md file of the student activity led by me, the Head of Embedded Systems. In this activity, we will explore the fascinating world of embedded systems, which are devices that combine hardware and software to perform specific functions. Embedded systems are everywhere, from smartphones to cars to robots. If you are interested in learning how to design, program, and debug embedded systems, this activity is for you!

The activity is divided into three phases, each with different objectives and challenges:

### [Beginner](/beginner)

In this phase, we will learn the basics of C programming language, which is widely used in embedded systems. We will also learn about data structures and algorithms, which are essential for solving problems and optimizing performance. We will practice our skills by writing simple programs and testing them on a simulator.

### [Intermediate](/intermediate)

In this phase, we will move on to interfacing and writing firmware for 8-bit microcontrollers (MCUs), such as AVR and PIC. These are small and low-cost chips that can control sensors, actuators, displays, and other peripherals. We will learn how to use various communication protocols, such as UART, SPI, and I2C, to connect our MCUs to external devices. We will also learn how to use timers, interrupts, and ADCs to handle timing and analog signals.

### [Advanced](/advanced)

In this phase, we will tackle more complex and powerful MCUs, such as ARM architectures. These are 32-bit processors that can run operating systems and support multitasking and networking. We will learn how to use FreeRTOS, a real-time operating system (RTOS) that can manage multiple tasks and resources efficiently. We will also implement some projects on embedded systems, such as a smart home system or a robotic arm.

By the end of this activity, you will have gained a solid foundation in embedded systems and acquired valuable skills that can help you in your future studies or career. I hope you enjoy this activity and learn a lot from it. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me anytime.
